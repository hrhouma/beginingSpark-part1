    * Let's take this case: In Linux, we might have two ways to display the help of a command:
    * --help or -h
    * We also have two ways to display the version of a command or a program:
    * --version or -v
    *
    * If no argument is allowed for a given command, the terminal shows the "USAGE" of it to help us find
    * the argument that we need to type.
    *
    * How will you do that using the pattern matching paradigm?
    *
    * Then...
    * ... print out loop from 1 to 10
    * ...then...from 1 to 10, print out every i divisible by two.
